/*
Question:
Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
*/

// Approach:
// Concat both vectors and compare them

impl Solution {
    pub fn array_strings_are_equal(word1: Vec<String>, word2: Vec<String>) -> bool {
        word1.concat() == word2.concat()
    }
}
